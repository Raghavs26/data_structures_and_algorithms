Hi Ayan Raj, hope you're well. I noticed the opening for a Software Engineer at Arcesium. With proficiency in both frontend development and DevOps, I have one year of professional experience, I believe my versatile skills align well with the requirements of the role. I have attached my resume for your reference. If possible, could you provide guidance on the application process or consider referring me? I'm eager to bring my skills to Arcesium's team. Thank you for your time and consideration.
